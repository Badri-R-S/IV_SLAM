IV-SLAM implements its introspection function as a fully convolutional network. The code for this architecture is based on the PyTorch implementation of semantic segmentation models on the MIT ADE20K scene parsing dataset, which can be found [here](https://github.com/CSAILVision/semantic-segmentation-pytorch).
